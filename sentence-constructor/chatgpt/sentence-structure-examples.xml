        - BAD: The vocabulary table does not include proper French accents or complete details.
        - BAD: The beginner sentence is unnecessary; it should begin directly with the vocabulary table.
        - BAD: The clues provide too much detail (e.g., suggesting polite forms), rather than letting the student figure it out.
        - BAD: The sentence structure explanation is overly verbose. We want a conceptual outline like: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible vocabulary table to get you started:

        | French  | English  |
        |---------|----------|
        | ours    | bear     |
        | porte   | door     |
        | ordures | garbage  |
        | laisser | to leave |

        Now, consider the sentence structure. We have two parts:
        - "Bears are at the door"
        - "did you leave the garbage out?"

        For the first part, think about using the verb (être) to express presence. Determine the correct form with proper subject-verb agreement.
        For the second part, consider the verb (laisser) and how to form a question about a past action.

        Here's a conceptual sentence structure:

        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Your turn! Try to complete the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.

        | to be (existence) | être    | verb (to express presence)             |
        | to leave          | laisser | verb                                   |

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
        - This compound sentence has two clauses separated by a comma.
        - The first clause states a location where something exists.
        - The second clause inquires about a past action.
        
        Next steps:
        - Try constructing the sentence using the provided vocabulary and structure.
        - Reflect on how to mark the location properly in French.
        - Think about connecting two clauses in a question.
        - Consider what hints you might need regarding verb conjugation for expressing past actions.
